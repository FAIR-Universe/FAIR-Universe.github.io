# Project Description

The FAIR Universe project is a collaboration between the [Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory](https://www.lbl.gov/), [Université Paris-Saclay](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en), [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/), and [ChaLearn](https://chalearn.org/). The project is funded by the [Department of Energy](https://www.energy.gov/).

The collaboration is building a large-compute-scale AI platform for the hosting of large scientific datasets, models, and machine learning competitions to drive forward discoveries in high energy physics and cosmology. The initial focus is on discovering and minimizing systematic uncertainties in High Energy Physics through a sequence of challenges that will bring together researchers across physics and machine learning.

The collaboration includes scientists from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Université Paris-Saclay, the University of Washington, and ChaLearn, a non-profit that organizes challenges to stimulate research in machine learning.

## October 2, 2023: First toy challenge

We have designed and released our first toy challenge [on the Codabench platform](https://www.codabench.org/competitions/1152/). This challenge is designed to test the platform and provide a simple example for the community to follow. We have developed a toy dataset to illustrate the types of analyses performed on real data from particle accelerators.


## November 29, 2023: Particle Physics challenge trial

We will be hosting a hackathon at the [Artificial Intelligence and the Uncertainty Challenge in Fundamental Physics](https://indico.in2p3.fr/event/30589/) workshop on Wednesday November 29, 2023. We are planning to release a tiral version of a challenge using detailed physics simulations of accelerator data. More information about the dataset and challenge will be released here closer to the date.
