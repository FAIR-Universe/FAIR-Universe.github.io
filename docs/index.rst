The Fair Universe project is organising the **HiggsML Uncertainty Challenge**, The context is the measurement of the Higgs Boson signal like in `HiggsML challenge on Kaggle <https://www.kaggle.com/c/higgs-boson>`_ in 2014, Participants should design an advanced analysis technique that can not only measure the signal strength but also provide a confidence interval, from which correct coverage will be evaluated automatically from pseudo-experiments.

The confidence interval should include statistical and systematic uncertainties (concerning detector calibration, background levels, etcâ€¦). It is expected that advanced analysis techniques that can control the impact of systematics will perform best, thereby pushing the field of uncertainty-aware AI techniques for HEP and beyond.
